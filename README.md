# DLNF - Projects
The repository contains my projects developed as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree ([DLNF](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)) at Udacity.

## List of projects:
- _DLNF-BikeShare_: 
I implemented a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
- _DLNF-Classification_: 
I built a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
- _DLNF-Scripts_: 
I built and trained a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpsons to generate new scripts.
- _DLNF-Translation_:
I build and trained a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation. 
- _DLNF-Faces_: 
I built a deep convolutional generative adversarial network using the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
